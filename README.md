# The Voidrice (My fork of Luke Smith <https://lukesmith.xyz>'s dotfiles).

These are the dotfiles deployed by my custom fork of LARBS.

## What is different
- Czech keyboard layout
- Optimized for using Qutebrowser as default browser
	- TBD: With a dmenu wrapper to choose different basedirs
	- With local startpages
	- Searching with Searx by default
- TBD: A heavier neovim rice with more bells and whistles
- TBD: OhMyZsh bells and whistles

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

Use my fork of [LARBS](https://github.com/jeandesuc/larbs) to autoinstall everything: (lmao, actually don't)

```
git clone https://github.com/jeandesuc/larbs
```

or clone the repo files directly to your home directory and install the
[dependencies](https://github.com/jeandesuc/LARBS/blob/master/progs.csv).
